# Scaffold React Typescript

This is my personal scaffold that I use as a starting point in the construction of a SPA. The minimal set (react + typescript) is present on the master.  Any new concept that has an application will be relegated to its own branch.

# Brances
* master (base)
 * webpack
 * react
 * typescript (to implement)
